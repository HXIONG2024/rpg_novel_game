# This is a RPG Novel Game using crewAI

## The idea of the game

My idea is that use genrative AI to generate the novel, while let the user to play the game by interacting with the novel.
So you are not just reading the novel, but also playing the game because you can make your decisions while playing the game.
The outcome of the game is generated by the AI, so the game is different every time you play it. 

## How to use

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main.py

## The process of the game

1. You will see the game_config folder once you run the main.py
2. The game_config folder will be used to store the game data such as the novel, the character, the item, etc.
3. once every chapter is generated, you will be asked to make decisions to the current chapter.
4. The decisions will be used to generate the next chapter.
5. The novel will continue as a loop until the end of the round or you choose to end the game or your health is 0.
6. I did't add the final chapter feature, so the novel will looks like a unfinished novel.
